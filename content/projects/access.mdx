## What this actually is

This is a Manufacturing Cost Intelligence System — basically a "flight simulator for business decisions" for a company that makes physical products.

In practice, it’s an interactive dashboard that lets a manager or executive simulate the financial impact of real-world shocks across their entire product line.

It’s built for people like a CFO, COO, or Operations Manager who need to answer big, expensive questions fast. The tool supports decisions like:

- **Reacting to supply chain shocks**  
  “Semiconductors just went up 15% globally. What’s the total annual hit to gross profit, and which products are now at risk of going negative?”

- **Strategic planning**  
  “Our union is negotiating a 5% wage increase. Can we absorb it, or do we need to raise prices? If we do, how does that change volume and revenue?”

- **Proactive management**  
  “Which products are truly profitable, and where are the hidden financial risks?”

It takes those messy, company-wide questions and turns them into clear numbers in seconds — and then lets an AI layer build the narrative on top.

## Why I cared enough to build it

Before this tool, answering “What happens if fuel costs go up?” looked like this:

1. Dig through multiple spreadsheets:
   - one with product recipes (BOM)
   - one with labor rates
   - another with supplier pricing
2. Change a few key cells and hope the web of formulas doesn’t break.
3. Guess the impact on one or two obvious products and ignore everything else.

It was slow, reactive, and felt more like “damage control” than decision-making.

I wanted a single place where you can:

- push one slider,  
- see portfolio-level impact,  
- and then talk about strategy instead of chasing formulas.

That’s the whole motivation.

## What actually worked

Three things feel “real” already:

### 1. The what-if engine

The core P&L simulator is the main win.  
Moving a slider like `+15% Semiconductors` and seeing the portfolio-wide annual impact in real time is the moment where this stops being a toy and starts being useful.

This used to take **days** of manual analysis in spreadsheets. Now it’s a few seconds.

### 2. The AI strategist

The AI doesn’t just say “chips bad, costs up.”

In a test “Semiconductor crisis” scenario, it:

- correctly flagged chips as the immediate pain,  
- but recommended focusing on **internal machine-time optimization** as the highest-leverage move,  
- using the Feasibility scores from the cost table to justify why.

So it’s not just rephrasing charts — it’s acting like a decent junior consultant with access to your actual numbers.

### 3. The portfolio health view

The “Stars” vs “At-Risk” view exposed some uncomfortable truths:

- some high-volume products that “felt” successful were surviving on razor-thin margins  
- those are now obvious candidates for price reviews or cost-reduction work

This is stuff that was technically there in the spreadsheets, but nobody saw it clearly.

## What’s still messy (being honest)

Some limitations I’m very aware of:

- **Static data**  
  All costs (materials, labor, logistics) come from CSVs.  
  For daily use, this needs live APIs (commodities, FX, freight indices, etc.).

- **Subjective Feasibility scores**  
  The Feasibility column in `manual_cost_drivers.csv` is my judgment call.  
  In a real company this would come from workshops and data, not “vibes.”

- **Overly linear model**  
  A 10% cost increase is currently treated as a 10% impact.  
  There’s no modeling of:
  - economies of scale  
  - volume discounts  
  - tiered pricing  
  - realistic demand elasticity

- **Region logic is simplified**  
  The whole thing behaves like a single “Texas-style” region.  
  A real deployment needs per-plant / per-region costs, taxes, and tariffs.

So it’s strong as a **thinking tool**, not yet a production-grade planning system.

## What I’d do next

Rough roadmap:

- **1. Live data integration**  
  Replace `manual_cost_drivers.csv` with:
  - live fuel prices  
  - FX rates  
  - maybe a basic freight index

- **2. Multi-driver scenarios**  
  Support stacked shocks like:
  - `+10% Steel`  
  - `+5% Labor`  
  - `−3% Logistics`  
  in the same run, with clean UI.

- **3. Monte-Carlo forecasting**  
  Let a user define volatility ranges around key costs, then run many simulations to get a distribution: best case, worst case, and likely band.

- **4. Conversational AI layer**  
  Turn the static report into a chat:
  - “What’s the ROI on the machine-time optimization?”  
  - “Compare the top three levers and list pros/cons.”

## Technical details (for people who care about the plumbing)

- **Stack**
  - Streamlit frontend
  - Pandas for data work
  - Plotly + FPDF2 + Kaleido for charts and export
  - OpenAI Chat API (`gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`) for the strategy brief

- **Data**
  - `bom_products.csv`: BOM per product (components, quantities, price, volume, elasticity, region)
  - `manual_cost_drivers.csv`: cost per component + Feasibility score
  - Joins: component key, trying `(Component, Region)` first, then `(Component, "Default")`

- **Engine**
  - `portfolio_simulator.py`: bottom-up cost simulation that rolls up to portfolio-level P&L
  - AI prompt engineering:
    - persona = “top-tier management consultant”
    - Feasibility hints to push it toward realistic internal levers
    - explicit “don’t just restate the graphs” constraints

- **Engineering**
  - `utils.py` runs validation on startup (duplicate costs, unit mismatches, etc.)
  - Core logic in `/app/core` decoupled from `/app/main.py` (Streamlit UI)
  - Secrets via `st.secrets` with a safe fallback prompt for API keys
