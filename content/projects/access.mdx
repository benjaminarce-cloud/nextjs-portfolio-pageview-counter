## What this actually is

This is a model + simple interface that lets you play with electricity, labor, and material
costs for a manufacturing line and see how product margins react. It’s not a perfect
digital twin, and it’s not “production software” yet. It’s a tool I’m building to move
conversations from “I feel like margins will drop” to “here’s roughly how much and why.”

## Why I cared enough to build it

I kept seeing margin conversations that were basically vibes:
someone mentions energy prices, someone else mentions labor, and the discussion
ends with “we should be careful” but no one can say how exposed we actually are.

The process engineer in me hates that. If we have a line, costs, and demand, we should
at least be able to run a few scenarios and see which products are fragile and which are
robust. This project is my attempt to build that kind of clarity from the ground up.

## What worked (so far)

- I can plug in different cost scenarios (energy, labor, materials) and quickly compare
  margin outcomes across products.
- The structure is simple enough that non-technical people can read the main assumptions
  and understand where the numbers come from.
- For me, it forced a much clearer breakdown of cost drivers: which ones move the needle,
  which ones barely matter, and which ones we were just talking about out of habit.

It’s not “finished”, but it’s already good enough to pressure-test basic assumptions and
have more grounded discussions.

## What was messy or incomplete (being honest)

- The demand side is oversimplified. Right now I’m not modeling realistic capacity
  constraints or more complex sales patterns.
- Some inputs are still educated guesses instead of being wired into live systems.
  That’s fine for exploration, but not for serious decision-making.
- The UI layer is basically a power-user tool. It works for me; it would confuse most
  people if I just dropped it on their desktop.

In other words: it’s a strong prototype, not a finished product.

## What I’d do next

If I had a dedicated block of time to push this further, I’d:

- Tighten the link to real data sources so cost drivers and prices are always up to date.
- Add a more realistic demand and capacity model, even if it stays lightweight.
- Clean up the interface so people can save scenarios, compare them, and share them without
  touching raw files.

Longer term, I’d like this to plug into a full “what-if” engine for manufacturing and
logistics decisions, not just a standalone margin calculator.
