## What this thesis is about

This thesis builds a **tri-objective simulation–optimization model** for a single, highly constrained stage in the semiconductor supply chain:

> the CoWoS/HBM advanced packaging chokepoint for high-end AI chips.

The model is designed to quantify the trade-off between:

- **Total cost**
- **Resilience** – service performance and recovery time under disruption
- **Life-cycle CO₂ emissions**

A key design choice is that it **does not assume cross-firm data sharing**. Instead, it focuses on the levers a single firm can realistically control at this node:

- how CoWoS/HBM capacity is allocated across regions,
- how much “safety” or surge capacity to hold,
- which transport modes to prioritize under pressure.

## Why this chokepoint matters

Semiconductors are the invisible infrastructure of the modern economy. A single advanced chip quietly sits behind smartphones, EVs, medical devices, cloud data centers, and large-scale AI systems.

The supply chain that produces those chips is:

- global and deeply segmented,
- full of geographic and technological chokepoints,
- and shaped by national security and industrial policy, not just cost.

CoWoS/HBM has become one of the most critical of these chokepoints because:

- AI accelerators are fundamentally limited by how fast they can move data between compute and memory.
- CoWoS packaging with HBM solves that by putting logic and stacked memory side-by-side on a silicon interposer, enabling **terabytes per second** of bandwidth at lower energy per bit.
- CoWoS/HBM capacity is far more concentrated than wafer fabrication and has been a binding constraint for AI GPU output.

Dependence on Taiwan makes this not just a technical bottleneck but a geopolitical one. A full-scale war is not something I try to simulate in detail, but it is the extreme case that exposes how fragile the system is. This thesis focuses on more operational but still serious shocks: multi-week CoWoS outages, HBM shortfalls, and logistics interruptions that can be represented in a simulation model.

## Resilience vs decarbonization at CoWoS/HBM

At this node, **resilience** and **decarbonization** do not automatically move in the same direction.

Making the system “more resilient” usually means adding slack:

- extra capacity,
- redundant sites,
- parallel routing options,
- faster (often dirtier and more expensive) transport modes.

On the other hand, decarbonization pushes toward:

- shifting volume to lower-carbon locations and grids,
- relying more on sea or rail instead of air,
- redesigning flows to reduce emissions per unit.

The same design decision that looks “green” in a carbon report can quietly erode resilience by stretching lead times or reducing buffer capacity. The thesis is about making that tension explicit at one chokepoint instead of treating “resilience” and “sustainability” as separate slide decks.

## How this positions in the literature

Three patterns in the existing work shaped this thesis:

1. **Resilience and sustainability are usually treated separately.**  
   Resilience papers focus on disruption and recovery. Sustainability papers focus on emissions and environmental impact. Very few models quantify how choices for one dimension move the other, and almost none do this at a semiconductor packaging chokepoint.

2. **“Just share more data” is the default answer.**  
   Many resilience frameworks end by recommending more transparency and collaboration across tiers. In semiconductors, where IP, export controls, and national security are central, broad symmetric data sharing is not a realistic baseline.

3. **There is little quantitative work at specific semi chokepoints.**  
   Reviews highlight packaging as a vulnerability but usually stop at conceptual discussion. There is a gap in tri-objective models focused on a specific node like CoWoS/HBM.

This thesis takes a more conservative and, in my view, more realistic stance: it asks what can be done **with the levers and information a single enterprise actually controls** at CoWoS/HBM, instead of assuming a fully cooperative, data-rich network.

## Research questions

The thesis focuses on three main questions:

- **RQ1.** What does the Pareto frontier between **total cost**, **resilience** (service performance and recovery time under disruption), and **life-cycle carbon emissions** look like for the CoWoS/HBM packaging network under a set of realistic disruption and carbon-price scenarios?

- **RQ2.** Among the **firm-controllable design levers** at this chokepoint—such as regional allocation of CoWoS/HBM capacity, safety capacity, and transport mode mix—which have the largest impact on a design’s position along that cost–resilience–carbon frontier?

- **RQ3.** How robust are selected Pareto-efficient designs to uncertainty in disruption severity and carbon prices, and in which regions of the frontier do resilience gains come into the sharpest conflict with decarbonization goals?

---

## Modeling approach (high level)

The thesis links two layers:

1. **Multi-objective optimization layer**

   - Generates candidate network designs / policies:
     - regional capacity splits
     - safety capacity levels
     - transport mode mixes
   - Treats cost, resilience metrics, and emissions as competing objectives.
   - Produces a set of Pareto-efficient designs rather than a single “best” answer.

2. **Simulation layer**

   - Runs discrete-event or Monte Carlo simulations over disruption scenarios:
     - multi-week CoWoS outages,
     - demand surges,
     - combined shocks.
   - For each candidate design, measures:
     - total cost,
     - service levels and recovery time,
     - life-cycle CO₂e.

Together they form an **ex-ante scenario tool**: the goal is not to predict the exact next shock, but to understand how different design choices change recovery behavior and emissions when shocks hit.

## Where this investigation is right now

As of now, the work is in an **early-to-mid build phase**:

- Introduction and motivation are drafted and iterating.
- Literature review is being built around three pillars:
  - resilience / disruption modeling,
  - decarbonization & multi-objective optimization,
  - semiconductor resilience and packaging.
- Model structure (sets, variables, objectives, constraints) is being formalized and translated into code.
- Disruption scenarios and a stylized CoWoS/HBM case study are being scoped.

As the thesis progresses, this page will be updated with:

- concrete model choices,
- early experimental frontiers,
- and links to drafts and slides.
