## What this actually is (plain language)

This is my “long game” project.

I’m trying to answer a very specific question:

**If the world keeps depending on Taiwan for advanced packaging, how do we make the semiconductor supply chain more resilient without just dumping the cost onto the climate?**

More concretely: I’m building a **tri-objective simulation–optimization model** for one very narrow, very important chokepoint in the global semi chain:

- CoWoS / HBM advanced packaging (the step that turns high-bandwidth memory + logic dies into the actual AI accelerators everyone is buying),
- under disruptions (outages, demand spikes, logistics shocks),
- with three objectives in conflict:
  - total cost,
  - resilience (service performance + recovery time),
  - life-cycle carbon emissions.

The goal is not “another generic resilience framework,” but a tool that shows, in numbers, **what trade-offs are even possible** when you *don’t* assume that all firms share data and cooperate.

---

## Why I cared enough to go this deep

Short version: I kept reading “just collaborate more” in the literature and didn’t buy it.

Most semiconductor resilience papers end with some version of:

> “firms should increase transparency, share data, and collaborate to coordinate responses.”

Sounds nice. Also sounds like something that will almost never fully happen in a world where:

- advanced chips are treated as strategic technologies,
- export controls and IP fights are normal,
- and one company (TSMC) sits in the crosshairs of both the U.S. and China.

So I wanted to flip the question:

> Assume no magical cross-firm data sharing.  
> What can a **single enterprise** still do, at the CoWoS/HBM stage, to buy resilience without blowing up cost and carbon?

This thesis is my attempt to answer that question in a way that is honest about the politics, not just the math.

## Where the thesis is right now

I’m still early, but the spine is there:

- **Motivation & context drafted**  
  I’ve written the introduction on semis as “invisible infrastructure,” why CoWoS/HBM is a chokepoint, and why resilience vs decarb isn’t a fake trade-off here.

- **Literature map sketched**  
  I’ve mapped three pillars:
  - quantitative resilience / disruption modeling (Ivanov, Hosseini, Klos),
  - decarbonization + multi-objective optimization (carbon pricing, emission factors),
  - semiconductor-specific resilience (Ramírez & Le, CSET, Wu).

- **Research questions locked**  
  Roughly:
  - What does the cost–resilience–carbon Pareto frontier look like at this chokepoint?
  - Which levers (regional capacity split, safety capacity, transport modes) move you along that frontier the most?
  - Where do resilience gains directly clash with decarb goals?

Right now I’m in the **“turn this into a clean model”** phase: formalizing sets, decisions, and objectives in math instead of vibes.

## How I’m planning to attack it (explainer version)

### 1. Model the network around the chokepoint

I focus on a minimal but realistic network:

- HBM suppliers → CoWoS packaging sites (for example: Taiwan, Japan, maybe a “new” region) → downstream DC/OEM.
- Flows move through these nodes with:
  - capacity limits,
  - lead times,
  - disruption risks,
  - emission factors for each leg and mode.

Key assumption: **no cross-firm data sharing.**  
All decisions are made with what one firm could plausibly know and control.

### 2. Optimization layer – design candidates

On top of that network I define a multi-objective optimization problem:

- **Decision variables**, like:
  - how to split volume across packaging regions,
  - how much “safety” capacity to hold,
  - what mix of transport modes to use by route (air vs sea, etc.).

- **Objectives:**
  - expected total cost,
  - resilience metrics (service level, recovery time under shocks),
  - expected emissions (CO2-equivalent) across production and logistics.

This layer does not spit out “the” best design.  
It generates **a set of good but different designs** that lie along the Pareto frontier.

### 3. Simulation layer – stress test those designs

Then I throw disruptions at each design using a discrete-event / Monte Carlo style simulator:

- multi-week outages of a CoWoS site,
- demand spikes on AI SKUs,
- combined shocks.

For each candidate design, the simulator measures:

- total cost under disruption,
- how badly service degrades,
- how long it takes to recover,
- and resulting emissions.

That’s how I map each design into the cost–resilience–carbon space.

### 4. Carbon accounting and pricing

For logistics and operations, I use fairly standard ideas:

- freight emissions ≈ tonnes × distance × mode-specific emission factor,
- process emissions tied to:
  - energy per unit at each site,
  - regional grid carbon intensity,
- optional carbon price scenarios that convert CO2 into equivalent cost.

The goal is not to predict exact grams, but to **make relative trade-offs visible** and consistent.

---

## What I expect to learn (and might be wrong about)

Honest version of the hypotheses I’m walking in with:

- You can get **surprisingly far** on resilience with just private levers (regional split, safety capacity, modes), even without industry-wide coordination.
- There will be **zones where resilience and decarb align** (for example, moving volume to cleaner but also more diversified sites).
- There will also be **ugly regions where resilience basically means “pay more and emit more”**, especially under tight carbon pricing and long-distance air freight.

If the model ends up saying something completely different, that’s even more interesting.

## Technical appendix (for the nerds)

If you care about the guts, here’s the current direction in bullet form:

- **Problem type:**  
  tri-objective simulation–optimization at a single chokepoint in a multi-echelon supply chain.

- **Decision layer:**
  - Sets: regions r, time periods t, product / flow types p, transport modes m.
  - Decisions (examples):
    - x_pr: share of product p allocated to packaging in region r,
    - c_r: additional “safety” capacity contracted in region r,
    - m_prt: share of flow (p, r) shipped by mode m in period t.

- **Objectives:**
  - f1: expected total cost (capacity, operations, logistics, penalties),
  - f2: resilience metric (for example, service loss or time to recovery aggregated over scenarios),
  - f3: life-cycle CO2 of packaging plus logistics.

- **Solution idea:**
  - Use a multi-objective heuristic (NSGA-II/III or similar) to generate candidate designs.
  - For each design, run a set of discrete-event / Monte Carlo simulations across disruption scenarios.

- **Emissions accounting (no LaTeX, just plain text):**
  - freight emissions: CO2 = distance × weight × emission_factor_mode
  - process emissions: CO2_packaging,r = energy_per_unit_r × grid_intensity_r
  - then run scenarios with different carbon prices to see how the frontier shifts.

This page will evolve as the thesis does. Right now, it’s the place where I keep myself honest about what is actually done vs still just living in my notes.
