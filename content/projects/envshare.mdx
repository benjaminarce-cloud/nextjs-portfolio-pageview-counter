## What this actually is 

This is my “long game” project.

I’m trying to answer a very specific question:  
**If the world keeps depending on Taiwan for advanced packaging, how do we make the semiconductor supply chain more resilient without just dumping the cost onto the climate?**

More concretely: I’m building a **tri-objective simulation–optimization model** for one very narrow, very important chokepoint in the global semi chain:

- CoWoS / HBM advanced packaging (the step that turns high-bandwidth memory + logic dies into the actual AI accelerators everyone is buying)  
- under disruptions (outages, demand spikes, logistics shocks)  
- with three objectives in conflict:
  - total cost  
  - resilience (service performance + recovery time)  
  - life-cycle carbon emissions  

The goal is not “another generic resilience framework,” but a tool that shows, in numbers, **what trade-offs are even possible** when you *don’t* assume that all firms share data and cooperate.

---

## Why I cared enough to go this deep

Short version: I kept reading “just collaborate more” in the literature and didn’t buy it.

Most semiconductor resilience papers end with some version of:  
“firms should increase transparency, share data, and collaborate to coordinate responses.”

Sounds nice. Also sounds like something that will never fully happen in a world where:

- advanced chips are called “strategic technologies”  
- export controls and IP wars are normal  
- and a single company (TSMC) sits in the crosshairs of both the U.S. and China  

So I wanted to flip the question:

> Assume no magical cross-firm data sharing.  
> What can a single enterprise still do, at the CoWoS/HBM stage, to buy resilience without blowing up cost and carbon?

This thesis is my attempt to answer that question in a way that is honest about the politics, not just the math.

## Where the thesis is right now

I’m still early, but the skeleton is clear:

- **Motivation and context drafted**  
  I’ve written the introduction on semis as “invisible infrastructure,” why CoWoS/HBM is a chokepoint, and why resilience vs decarb isn’t a fake trade-off here.

- **Literature map sketched**  
  I’ve mapped three pillars:
  - quantitative resilience / disruption modeling (Ivanov, Hosseini, Klos)  
  - decarbonization + multi-objective optimization (carbon pricing, emission factors)  
  - semiconductor-specific resilience (Ramírez & Le, CSET, Wu)  

- **Research questions locked**  
  Roughly:
  - What does the cost–resilience–carbon Pareto frontier look like at this chokepoint?  
  - Which levers (regional capacity split, safety capacity, transport modes) move you along that frontier the most?  
  - Where do resilience gains directly clash with decarb goals?  

Right now I’m in the **“turn all this into a clean model”** phase: formalizing sets, decisions, and objectives in math instead of vibes.

## How I’m planning to attack it 

### 1. Model the network around the chokepoint

I focus on a minimal but realistic network:

- HBM suppliers → CoWoS packaging sites (e.g. Taiwan, Japan, maybe a “new” region) → downstream DC/OEM  
- flows with:
  - capacity limits  
  - lead times  
  - disruption risks  
  - emission factors for each leg and mode  

Key assumption: **no cross-firm data sharing.**  
All decisions are made with what one firm could plausibly know.

### 2. Optimization layer – design candidates

On top of that network I define a multi-objective optimization problem:

- Decision variables:
  - how to split volume across packaging regions  
  - how much “safety” capacity to hold  
  - what mix of transport modes to use by route (air vs sea, etc.)  

- Objectives:
  - \( f_1 \): expected total cost  
  - \( f_2 \): resilience metrics (service level, recovery time under shocks)  
  - \( f_3 \): expected emissions (CO₂e) across production and logistics  

This layer doesn’t say “this is the one best design.”  
Instead, it finds **a set of good but different designs** that lie along the Pareto frontier.

### 3. Simulation layer – stress test those designs

Then I throw disruptions at each design using a discrete-event / Monte-Carlo style simulator:

- multi-week outages of a CoWoS site  
- demand spikes on AI SKUs  
- combined shocks  

For each candidate design, the simulator measures:

- total cost under disruption  
- how badly service degrades  
- how long it takes to recover  
- resulting emissions  

That’s how I map each design onto the cost–resilience–carbon space.

### 4. Carbon accounting and pricing

For logistics and operations, I use standard-ish approaches:

- freight emissions = tonnes × distance × mode-specific emission factor  
- process emissions tied to regional grid intensity and process energy per unit  
- optional carbon price scenarios that convert CO₂ into equivalent cost  

The point is not to predict exact grams, but to **make relative trade-offs visible** and consistent.

---

## What I expect to learn (and maybe be wrong about)

Honest version of the hypotheses I’m walking in with:

- You can get **surprisingly far** on resilience with just private levers (regional split, safety capacity, modes), even without industry-wide coordination.  
- There will be **regions on the frontier where resilience and decarb align** (for example, moving volume to cleaner but also more diversified sites).  
- There will also be **ugly regions where resilience basically means “pay more and emit more”**, especially under tight carbon pricing and long-distance air freight.

If the model ends up saying something completely different, that’s even more interesting.

## Technical appendix 

If you care about the guts, here’s the current direction in bullet form:

- **Problem type:** tri-objective simulation–optimization at a single chokepoint in a multi-echelon supply chain.  

- **Decision layer:**
  - Sets: regions \( r \), time periods \( t \), product / flow types \( p \), transport modes \( m \).  
  - Decisions:
    - \( x_{pr} \): share of product \( p \) allocated to packaging in region \( r \)  
    - \( c_r \): additional “safety” capacity contracted in region \( r \)  
    - \( m_{prt} \): share of flow \( p,r \) shipped by mode \( m \) in period \( t \)  

- **Objectives:**
  - \( f_1 \): expected total cost (capacity, operations, logistics, penalties)  
  - \( f_2 \): resilience metric (for example, service loss / time to recovery aggregated over scenarios)  
  - \( f_3 \): life-cycle CO₂e of packaging + logistics  

- **Solution idea:**
  - Use a multi-objective heuristic (NSGA-style) to generate candidate designs.  
  - For each design, run a set of discrete-event / Monte-Carlo simulations across disruption scenarios.  

- **Emissions accounting:**
  - freight emissions: \( \text{CO₂} = d \times w \times EF_{mode} \)  
  - process emissions: \( \text{CO₂}_{packaging,r} = E_{unit,r} \times \text{grid\_intensity}_r \)  
  - scenario runs with different carbon prices to see how the frontier shifts  

As the thesis matures, I’ll keep updating this page as a log of what changed and what actually worked.
