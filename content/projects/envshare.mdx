## What this actually is

This thesis develops a **tri-objective simulation–optimization model** for the CoWoS/HBM advanced packaging chokepoint in the global semiconductor supply chain.

The model is designed to quantify the trade-off between:

- **Cost**
- **Resilience** (service loss and recovery time under shocks)
- **Life-cycle CO₂ emissions**

A key design choice is that it **does not rely on cross-firm data sharing**. Instead, it focuses on levers a single firm can realistically control, such as:

- regional allocation of advanced packaging,
- safety / surge capacity,
- and transport modes (air vs sea).

## Core research questions

Right now the thesis is organized around questions like:

- **RQ1.** What does the Pareto frontier between **cost**, **resilience**, and **carbon emissions** look like for CoWoS/HBM packaging under realistic disruption scenarios?
- **RQ2.** Which **enterprise-controllable levers** (regional capacity split, safety capacity, transport modes, etc.) actually move you along that frontier?
- **RQ3.** How far can a single firm go in improving resilience and decarbonization **without** assuming industry-wide information sharing and collaboration?

These questions are the “north star” that everything else (literature, modeling, experiments) hangs off.

## Why semiconductors, why CoWoS/HBM, why this trade-off

Semiconductors are a **systemic input**: AI, autos, defense, and basically every modern industry run through them.

Within that system, CoWoS/HBM advanced packaging has become a chokepoint because:

- AI demand is exploding,
- CoWoS capacity is limited and geographically concentrated,
- HBM + advanced packaging are tightly coupled to both **performance** and **reliability**.

At the same time, firms are under pressure to **decarbonize**:

- cleaner grids and locations,
- lower-carbon freight,
- but these choices can conflict with resilience (e.g., slower but greener transport).

Most of the literature treats **resilience** and **sustainability** separately, or assumes that firms will happily share data and coordinate. This thesis explicitly asks:

> “What can you realistically do if nobody wants to share their internals with you?”

## How I’m structuring the work

The roadmap behind this thesis is roughly:

### 1. Introduction & context

- Motivate semiconductors as a systemic risk.
- Explain, in normal language, what CoWoS/HBM is and why it’s a bottleneck.
- Frame the **resilience vs decarbonization** tension at this node.
- Position the work against the existing resilience / decarb literature and the “just share data” assumption.

### 2. Literature backbone

Three main pillars:

- **Resilience / disruption modeling**  
  Simulation–optimization frameworks, ripple effect, disruption and recovery metrics.

- **Decarbonization & multi-objective optimization**  
  How others embed CO₂ into cost models, use carbon prices, and build multi-objective frontiers.

- **Semiconductor-specific context**  
  Where packaging sits in the global semi supply chain and what is known about its vulnerabilities.

The outcome is a clear gap: **no tri-objective sim–opt model at a specific semi chokepoint under no-sharing constraints.**

### 3. Methodology: formal model + simulation

- Define the network:
  - nodes (HBM suppliers, CoWoS sites in TW/JP/US, downstream DC/OEM),
  - flows (HBM → CoWoS → DC → OEM),
  - disruption types (e.g. multi-week CoWoS outage).
- Build a formal **multi-objective optimization model**:
  - decision variables: regional allocation, safety capacity, transport mode shares,
  - objectives: expected cost, service / recovery metrics, life-cycle CO₂.
- Couple it to a **simulation layer** that:
  - plays out disruptions and demand scenarios,
  - measures recovery time, lost demand, and emissions under each candidate policy.

### 4. Carbon accounting module

- Use freight emissions logic (distance × tonnes × mode emission factors).
- Combine process energy per unit with regional grid intensity for packaging.
- Optionally translate CO₂ into a cost dimension via carbon pricing scenarios.

### 5. Case study & experiments

- Set up a stylized but plausible CoWoS/HBM network (locations, capacities, distances, emission factors).
- Run disruption and carbon-price scenarios.
- Generate 2D/3D Pareto frontiers and sensitivity plots.
- Interpret when resilience and decarbonization are aligned vs in tension.

## Where it is right now

Very honestly, the thesis is currently in the **early-to-mid build** stage:

- Phase 0/1: core idea + introduction are locked and iterating.
- Literature review is sketched with clear gaps identified.
- Model structure (sets, variables, objectives, constraints) is defined on paper and being translated into code.
- Simulation details and carbon module are being refined around a CoWoS/HBM case study.

As the work evolves, this page will be updated with:

- more precise model choices,
- early experimental results,
- and links to drafts / slides / code.
