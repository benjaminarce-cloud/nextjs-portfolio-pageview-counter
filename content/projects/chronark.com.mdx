## Context

Operations needed a way to understand how margins behave under different cost and demand scenarios without juggling 20 spreadsheets.

## What I built

- A Python model tying electricity, labor, and material costs to product margins.
- A scenario engine to compare multiple configurations.
- An interface where non-technical users can change assumptions and see margin impact immediately.

## My role

- Designed the cost-driver structure like a process engineer: map → measure → model → iterate.
- Implemented the simulation logic in Python.
- Worked with stakeholders to cut vanity metrics and focus on the few decisions that matter.

## Why it matters

It turns “I think margins will drop” into “Here’s how much and why, under specific scenarios.”
