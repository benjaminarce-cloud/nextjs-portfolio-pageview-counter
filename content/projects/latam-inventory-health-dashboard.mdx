## What this actually is

This is an **Inventory Health Dashboard** for a regional supply chain team in LATAM.

Every day, they get an export from an upstream analytics system (Incorta) with:

- on-hand stock by material and country,
- safety stock levels,
- some basic metadata.

Instead of:

- manually opening that file,
- filtering it a hundred different ways,
- and guessing where the problems are,

this project turns that daily email into:

- a Power BI dashboard,
- refreshed automatically,
- with a **traffic-light status** for each material and country:

- green: stock comfortably above safety stock,  
- yellow: getting close,  
- red: below safety stock, attention needed.

You can slice it by:

- country,
- material code,
- status (green / yellow / red),

and quickly answer the question:  
**“Where are we exposed right now?”**

## Why this needed to exist

The starting point was very basic but very real:

- planners were getting a report in their inbox every morning,
- opening it in Excel,
- scrolling around until they spotted something scary,
- and then reacting.

There was no:

- consistent definition of “healthy” vs “risky” stock,
- portfolio-level view by country,
- quick way to explain to leadership where the real problems were.

It was all:

- “I think we’re okay in Country A,”  
- “We might be tight in Country B,”  
- and a lot of “let me check and get back to you.”

This dashboard is my attempt to fix that with the least amount of drama:

- use the report they already have,
- automate the boring part,
- give them a single place where they can see what actually matters.

---

## What actually worked

A few things clicked nicely:

### 1. The traffic-light logic made conversations simpler

Instead of debating raw numbers, people started talking in a shared language:

- “How many reds do we have in Country X?”  
- “Why is this material stuck in yellow for the third week?”  

The exact thresholds are simple, but having them codified in the model turned vague concerns into concrete questions.

---

### 2. The automation chain quietly removed a daily chore

The data pipeline is simple but effective:

- the Incorta report arrives by email,
- Power Automate detects the attachment and drops it into a SharePoint folder,
- Power BI is wired to that folder and refreshes on schedule.

Nobody has to:

- download attachments,
- rename files,
- or remember to refresh the dashboard.

It just shows up.

---

### 3. The “one-page view” of LATAM changed the discussion

Before this, each country was kind of its own universe.

With the dashboard:

- you can see all countries side by side,
- compare how many materials are in red or yellow,
- and spot patterns, like:
  - a specific material that is chronically understocked everywhere,
  - or a country that always sits on too much inventory.

It turned “how are we doing?” from a feeling into a picture.

## Where it is still rough (being honest)

This is not some perfect, global control tower. A few limitations:

- **Still tied to a single upstream report**  
  If the Incorta layout changes, everything breaks. There is no robust schema control or validation layer yet.

- **Safety stock is taken as a given**  
  The dashboard treats safety stock as truth.  
  It does not question whether those levels are well calibrated, which is probably where a lot of value is hiding.

- **No forward-looking view**  
  Everything is “as of today.”  
  There is no demand forecast overlay, no lead time view, and no estimate of how fast a green could become a red.

- **No formal alerting yet**  
  The visual is strong, but there is no automated alert like:
  > “Send me an email when a red appears in these key SKUs.”

So: it is a big step up from raw Excel, but it is still V1.

---

## What I would do next

If I had another chunk of time on this, I would push it in three directions:

1. **Make the data more robust**
   - add a small validation step so if the upstream file changes structure, the pipeline fails loudly instead of silently giving wrong numbers,
   - log ingestion history so you can see which days did or did not refresh correctly.

2. **Question safety stock instead of just visualizing it**
   - pull in demand history,
   - recompute candidate safety stock levels,
   - and show where the current settings look too conservative or too risky.

3. **Add alerts and simple workflows**
   - let users subscribe to specific materials or countries,
   - send a daily or weekly summary like:
     > “3 new reds in Country A, 2 resolved in Country B.”

## Technical details (for people who care about the plumbing)

- **Tools**
  - Data source: daily Incorta export delivered by email,
  - Orchestration: Power Automate (email to SharePoint),
  - Storage: SharePoint folder as the raw file landing zone,
  - BI layer: Power BI.

- **Data flow**
  1. Incorta sends a daily report (typically Excel or CSV).
  2. Power Automate flow:
     - triggers on new email from a specific sender / subject,
     - saves the attachment into a dated folder in SharePoint.
  3. Power BI:
     - connects to that SharePoint folder,
     - uses a Power Query step to:
       - clean column names,
       - select relevant fields (material, plant/country, on-hand quantity, safety stock, etc.),
       - add a calculated “status” column (green / yellow / red).

- **Dashboards and logic**
  - Core calculated measures:
    - `StockGap = OnHand - SafetyStock`,
    - `Status =`  
      - green: StockGap well above threshold,  
      - yellow: StockGap close to zero within a band,  
      - red: StockGap below zero.
  - Visuals:
    - summary cards (count of greens, yellows, reds),
    - table by country and material with status colors,
    - slicers for:
      - country,
      - material code,
      - status.

- **My role**
  - designed the status logic and thresholds,
  - set up the Power Automate flow and SharePoint structure,
  - built the Power BI model and visuals,
  - iterated with the team based on how they actually used it day to day.

I cannot show the real data for obvious reasons, but the architecture and ideas are the important part.  
If you are curious about the layout or want a generic version of the PBIX, reach out and I can sketch a sanitized example.
